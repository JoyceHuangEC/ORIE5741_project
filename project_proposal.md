### Introduction and Importance
Movies are one of the most important forms of entertainment worldwide, and the market size is predicted to grow even further in the near future. However, whether a movie will be successful or not depends on a number of factors. Our group would like to dive into this field and try to predict whether a movie would be a commercial success given data on cast, crew, budget and so on. We believe that this is important because a movie production usually costs hundreds of millions of dollars and a long period of time, and it would largely help the business company to determine if a movie would be a success and how much money it would  possibly bring. 

### Dataset and Justification

We intend to use the TMDb 5000 Movie Dataset which contains exhaustive information about films, including not only direct information about a  movie like its genre and title, but also information about casts, crews, popularity, budget, production company and historical information of the production team. The wide variety of types of information guarantees the comprehension of our analysis.
We believe that this dataset will be able to capture valuable features about the box-office revenue for movies and therefore be able to predict the revenue in a preferable accuracy for film production companies before actual screenings.

### Cleaning and Methodology
Since there are many N/A and empty values in the original dataset, the first step would be to do data cleaning. For example, remove lines with invalid revenue, fill out empty cells with information online, and get rid of features that are not related to the box office.
After cleaning the big messy data, we plan to try out different kinds of models, for example, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, and Random Forest. We aim to compare the results of these different models and then focus on the one with the best performance.
