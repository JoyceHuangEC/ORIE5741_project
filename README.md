Project Name: Movie Revenue Prediction

Project Members: Yihan Zhang(yz476), Shuyan Huang(sh2429), Chuntian Chi(cc2234)

Movies are one of the most important forms of entertainment worldwide, and the market size is predicted to grow even further in the near future. However, whether a movie will be successful or not depends on a number of factors. Our group would like to dive into this field and try to predict whether a movie would be a commercial success given data on cast, crew, budget and so on. We believe that this is important because a movie production usually costs hundreds of millions of dollars and a long period of time, and it would largely help the business company to determine if a movie would be a success and how much money it would  possibly bring.
